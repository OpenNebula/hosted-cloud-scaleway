# Deployment Guide


## üèóÔ∏è Target OpenNebula Architecture
This section describes the target architecture based on OpenNebula, deployed on Scaleway Elastic Metal instances.

### Objectives:
Deliver a full IaaS infrastructure on bare-metal servers.

#### Core Components:
OpenNebula Front-end (with KVM):

Manages VM lifecycle, networking, and storage and provides Opennebula Frontend.
Also runs local virtual machines (acts as a compute node).

#### Hypervisor Nodes:

EM-A610R-NVMe instances running KVM.
Connected to private network for internal communication.
Can also be attached to Public IP for providing access to VM.

#### Storage:

Local NVMe SSDs on each node.

### Networking:

Virtual Network using Private Networks in VPC.
For high traffic Public gateway is the goto, but for one deploy and MVP Public IP directly attached to instances via NIC.

### Provisioning Strategies 

#### Usage of one deploy and one deploy validation hook

Deployment can be done using onedeploy hook as per theses documentations 
* https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-deploy-validation/tree/master
* https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-deploy
  
This hook is rely on ansible scaleway provider
